# Student File Submission System

This project is a Python-based file submission system that allows students to submit their assignments via a GUI application. The system consists of a server application and a client application. The server receives files from clients and stores them in a designated folder, while the client allows students to select files, optionally compress them, and send them to the server.

## Features

### Server Application
- **GUI Interface:** The server has a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, displaying logs, active connections, and other relevant information.
- **File Storage:** Files received from clients are saved in the `bucket_storage` directory.
- **Real-time Logs:** The server logs incoming connections, file transfers, and other activities in real-time.
- **Customizable Settings:** The server IP, port, and chunk size can be adjusted via the settings tab.

### Client Application
- **GUI Interface:** The client has a simple and intuitive GUI, allowing students to select files for submission.
- **File Compression:** Multiple files can be compressed into a single ZIP file before submission.
- **Theme Toggle:** Users can switch between light and dark themes in the client application.
- **Progress Tracking:** The client displays a progress bar during file uploads, providing feedback on the submission process.
